Here are the frame durations for each animation image (assuming game runs on 60fps):

DragonStand (sprite for when they are sitting in the nest - not animated for now)
DragonDrag (sprite for when the dragon is being dragged - not animated for now)
DragonFlap (this is the one where the poor thing struggles to stay airborne): 1 frame per image
DragonFlyOff (this is when the dragon is no longer a padawan and learns to fly off): 3 frames per image
Wind (blowin some steam): 2 frames per image

Penis (object of desire): As many frames per second as possible
